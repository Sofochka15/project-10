<p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy <u>text</u> of the printing and typesetting industry. </p>
<p><b><i>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark>1500s</mark>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </i> </p>
<p>It has survived not only five centuries,but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentiallyunchanged.  It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <b><s>Aldus PageMaker</s></b> including version of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
